# DT_Test
DT Package Testing

Shiny App for testing JS/HTML/Ajax with DT package, manipulating functions found online, or developed in order to produce experimental results.

## Part 1 - Expandable Rows
Initially we test child rows in Ajax to see how it behaves with a dplyr created data.frame, essentially uses callback to create a new table under each row based on the value within the first column.
